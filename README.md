I am a Computer Science major at Drexel University, specializing in Game Development and Artificial Intelligence. My passion for game development began at 13, and since then,
I have been dedicated to turning this dream into reality through continuous learning and hands-on experience. My journey started in 2016 at the Information Technologies Center Mziuri, 
where I spent five years immersing myself in programming languages, algorithms, and mathematical logic. I began with Free Pascal, a foundational language that introduced me to core programming concepts. 
After a year of mastering Pascal, I progressed to C++, where I applied my skills to solve competitive coding challenges on platforms like Codeforces, deepening my problem-solving abilities.
The turning point came when I transitioned to Unity and C#—my first steps in game development. At 14, I created my first game, a project that, while simple by today’s standards, was a major achievement for me. 
This game was honored as the best in my class and was later showcased at a collaborative event with a university in Tbilisi, Georgia, as a highlight of our school's achievements.
While I couldn’t retrieve the source files for this project, I still have a playable build in my GitHub repository titled Guess the Country.
Following my passion further, I completed a one-year Java course and earned a certificate in Programming Languages and Game Development from Mziuri. Now, as a Computer Science major at Drexel,
I continue to build on this foundation, focusing on advanced AI techniques and game programming. My long-term aspiration is to establish my own game studio in Georgia, 
creating innovative and immersive gaming experiences that push the boundaries of technology.
