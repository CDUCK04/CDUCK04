I am a Computer Science major at Drexel University, specializing in Game Development and Artificial Intelligence. Since the age of 13, Iâ€™ve been driven by a passion for game development, continually honing my skills to turn this dream into reality. 
My journey began in 2016, immersing myself in programming languages and development at infromation technologies center Mziuri, and has since evolved into a deep commitment to mastering both technical and creative aspects of game design. 
My academic focus at Drexel allows me to integrate advanced AI techniques with game programming, equipping me to create innovative, interactive experiences that push the boundaries of gaming technology.
