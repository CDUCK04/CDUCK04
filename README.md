I am a Computer Science major at Drexel University, specializing in Game Development and Artificial Intelligence. My passion for game development began at 13, and since then, 
I have been dedicated to transforming this dream into reality through continuous learning and hands-on experience. My journey started in 2016 at the Information Technologies Center Mziuri, 
where I spent five years immersing myself in programming languages, algorithms, and mathematical logic. I began with Free Pascal, one of the foundational languages, which introduced me to the core concepts of programming. 
After a year of mastering Pascal, I advanced to C++, applying it to solve competitive coding problems on platforms like Codeforces. C++ deepened my problem-solving skills over the course of a year.
The real turning point came when I transitioned to Unity and C#—my first steps in game development. At 14, I created my very first game, which, although simple by today’s standards, was a major achievement at the time. 
This project was honored as the best in my class and later showcased at a collaboration event with a university in Tbilisi, Georgia, as a highlight of our school's achievements.
Following my passion further, I completed a one-year Java course and received a certificate in Programming Languages and Game Development from Mziuri. Now, as a Computer Science major at Drexel,
I continue to build on this foundation, combining my focus on advanced AI techniques with game programming. I aspire not only to make a mark in the game development industry but also to one day establish my own game studio in Georgia, 
creating innovative and immersive gaming experiences that push the boundaries of technology.
